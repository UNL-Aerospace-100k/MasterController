# MasterController
For programming the Arduino NANO located on the Master Controller Controls Panel

THIS IS OUT OF DATE

An Arduino NANO on a hand held controlls panel interprets the inputs to its GPIO and then sends out LoRa signals to the SubmasterController. This is no longer needed, and has been replaced by a XBEE on an explorer board being interfaced on a laptop with XTCU installed and setup.
